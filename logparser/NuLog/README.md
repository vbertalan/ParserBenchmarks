## NuLog

Parsing semi-structured records with free-form text log messages into structured templates is the first and crucial step that enables further analysis. NuLog presents a novel parsing technique that utilizes a self-supervised learning model and formulates the parsing task as masked language modeling (MLM). In the process of parsing, the model extracts summarizations from the logs in the form of a vector embedding. This allows the coupling of the MLM as pre-training with a downstream anomaly detection task. 


### Running

Note that we modify NuLog to support both CPU and GPU devices. We run the experiments on a P100 GPU machine.

Install the required enviornment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following script to start the demo:

```
python demo.py
```

Run the following script to execute the benchmark:

```
python benchmark.py
```

### Benchmark

Running the benchmark script on Loghub_2k datasets, you could obtain the following results.
